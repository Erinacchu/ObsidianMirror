# README

This page serves as a mirror to my obsidian notes. 

The use is only for private purposes, this domain should not be publicly discoverable.

## Host it yourself

```git
git clone https://github.com/Erinacchu/ObsidianMirror.git
```

Then do:
```
npm run install
npm run
```
Or if you are cool, you use bun.sh

```
bun run dev
```

Make sure to add your files inside of the `obsidian` folder.
Currently, only files with the extension .md can be opened.

If you can find out how to use fs.readFile reactive, please let me know.
